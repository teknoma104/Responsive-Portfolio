                Hello! My name is Tommy Le. I absolutely love to play video games and hang out with good friends. As well as listen to different
                kinds of music. My current games that I am playing are Final Fantasy XIV Online, Overwatch, and Monster Hunter
                World on the PS4. I like all kinds of gaming genres, from roleplaying games to first person shooters. I also
                like sports car and currently own a 10th generation 2007 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution MR edition. One day,
                I hope to get myself a Nissan GTR. :)

                I was born here in Dallas, TX along with my two other brothers. My parents were born in Vietnam. My mother is from the city
                of Đà Nẵng and my father is from the city of Bến Tre. I received my very first computer in the form of a
                Pentium 1 Packard Bell at the age of 12 and that lead the way for my love of computers and technology. I
                also learned how to make my parents angry back when America Online (AOL) used to charge by the hour instead
                of unlimited usage. ;) I was able to disassemble and reassemble computers by the age of 15 and was already
                familiar with the internet at an early age. I attended the University of Texas at Dallas back in 2001. I
                graduated 5 years later with two bachelors of sciences in Computer Science and Software Engineering.
